### Creating a Topic in ROS2
```
ros2 topic pub /camera_topic std_msgs/String "data: Hello World"

```

### How to publish a message to a ros2 topic running on docker from a service running outside docker

To publish a message to a ROS 2 topic running in a Docker container from a service outside Docker, you'll need to set up network communication between the host machine and the Docker container. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Configure the Docker network:
   When running your ROS 2 Docker container, use the host network mode:

   ```
   docker run --network host your_ros2_image
   ```

   This allows the container to share the host's network stack.

2. Find the host machine's IP address:
   On the host machine, determine its IP address. On Linux, you can use:

   ```
   ip addr show
   ```

   Look for the IP address of your main network interface (usually eth0 or wlan0).

3. Configure ROS_DOMAIN_ID:
   Ensure that both the Docker container and the external service use the same ROS_DOMAIN_ID. Set this environment variable in both environments:

   ```
   export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=<some_number>
   ```

   Choose a number between 0 and 101 (inclusive).

4. Install ROS 2 on the host machine:
   Your external service needs ROS 2 installed to communicate with ROS topics. Install the same ROS 2 distribution as in your Docker container.

5. Create a simple Python script to publish messages:
   Here's an example script that publishes a string message to a topic:

   ```python
   import rclpy
   from rclpy.node import Node
   from std_msgs.msg import String

   class MinimalPublisher(Node):
       def __init__(self):
           super().__init__('minimal_publisher')
           self.publisher_ = self.create_publisher(String, 'topic', 10)
           timer_period = 0.5  # seconds
           self.timer = self.create_timer(timer_period, self.timer_callback)
           self.i = 0

       def timer_callback(self):
           msg = String()
           msg.data = f'Hello World: {self.i}'
           self.publisher_.publish(msg)
           self.get_logger().info(f'Publishing: "{msg.data}"')
           self.i += 1

   def main(args=None):
       rclpy.init(args=args)
       minimal_publisher = MinimalPublisher()
       rclpy.spin(minimal_publisher)
       minimal_publisher.destroy_node()
       rclpy.shutdown()

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       main()
   ```

6. Run the publisher:
   Execute the script on your host machine:

   ```
   python3 publisher_script.py
   ```

7. Verify communication:
   In your Docker container, run a ROS 2 command to echo the messages:

   ```
   ros2 topic echo /topic
   ```

   You should see the messages being received in the Docker container.

This approach allows your external service to publish messages to the ROS 2 topic running in the Docker container. Remember to adjust firewall settings if necessary and ensure that the ROS_DOMAIN_ID is consistent across environments.
